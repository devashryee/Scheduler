                <h1>Project Requirements </h1>

                 <p><b>The Problem</b>
                 <br>
                    At one of the most renowned universities in the world, NYUâ€™s computer science department schedules all of their courses manually. Each semester, an individual must spends several days planning courses, professors, classrooms,  and times.
                </p>
  

                 <p><b>A Solution</b>
                 <br>
                     A high level back-end service that has advanced algorithms to place priority on certain courses, integrated with a user friendly front-end service that allows the user to manually input certain values.
                </p>

                <p><b>Requirements</b>
                <br>
                    The requirements are broken up into two sections: hard constraints and soft constraints. Hard constraints are rules that cannot be broken when scheduling courses. Soft constraints are rules that we would like to adhere to, but it is okay to break in order to maintain the integrity of the hard constraints.

                 <p id="indent">
                    <u>Hard Constraints:</u>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A professor cannot be scheduled for two courses at the same time.</li>
                        <li>No two classes can be scheduled in the same room.</li>
                        <li>The size of the class cannot be more than the capacity of the room.</li>
                        <li>No classes can begin before time x or end after time y.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                 <p id="indent">
                    <u>Soft Constraints:</u>
                   <ul>
                        <li>Do not put any professor on back to back courses</li>
                        <li>Do not schedule two courses at the same time if they are usually taken during the same semester (e.g. Physics 1 and Calculus 2).</li>
                        <li>Courses are typically either on Monday/Wednesday or Thursday/Friday, and sometimes accompanied with a lab or recitation.</li>
                    </ul>
    
                 </p>
                </p>


                <p><b>User Input</b>
                <br>
                     The user will be required to provide an input for the back-end to work with. Some of the inputs required from the user are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A list of all courses offered that semester</li>
                        <li>A list of all professors available, and the courses they teach</li>
                        <li>Professor schedule constraints (e.g. they are not available before 5 pm on weekdays)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
